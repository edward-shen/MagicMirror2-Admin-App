# Magic Mirror Admin App

This is a crossplatform app to control your mirror from your phone!

It implements most of the features of [Jopyth's MMM-Remote-Control][1], and is effectively a native implementation
of it's web API.

This is a great method to interact with your mirror if you do not have a physical interface!

Supported features include:
* Remote restart and shutdown of your Raspberry Pi
* Restart, refresh, and updating of your MagicMirror platform
* Module Info
* [MMM-Pages][2] support

## Installation

1. Please install [Jopyth's MMM-Remote-Control] by follow his instructions on his page.
2. Download the app (Link currently unavailable)
3. Enter your mirror's local IP address (For most cases, this should be in the form of `192.168.1.x`) in the app.
4. If you changed your default port, please enter that into the app as well.

## Plammed features
- [ ] UI revamp (Day and night mode)
- [ ] Implement module hide/showing
- [ ] Removing all those console loggings...

## Thanks and Credits
Thanks to Jopyth for his MMM-Remote-Control module. Without his work, this app would not have been possible!
