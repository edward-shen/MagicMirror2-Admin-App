Act like an adult.

Gender, age, sexual preference, race, etc. will never be a consideration. We simply don't care who you are as
you intend to help us.

Be nice and respectful.

Criticisms and suggestions will *always* be permitted and accepted.

If you have any issues, feel free to private message any one of the maintainers. We promise to resolve any
reasonable issue within a reasonable time frame.

Use better judgement.

... Honestly, most of this shouldn't need to be said, right?
