Pull requests should be only about a single issue. Do not lump in multiple features/bugfixes,
unless you are absolutely certain that all features will be unconditionally accepted.

If you do decide to combine multiple features in a pull request, please be extremely detailed
in your descriptions. Not that more features in a single pull request may delay your request
from being accpeted.

Please do not make pull requests solely for fixing formatting/whitespace.
